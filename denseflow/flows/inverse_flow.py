    Base class for InverseFlow.
    Inverse flows use the forward transforms to transform noise to samples.
    These are typically useful as variational distributions.
    Here, we are not interested in the log probability of novel samples.
    However, using .sample_with_log_prob(), samples can be obtained together
    with their log probability.
